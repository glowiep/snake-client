# Snek Game

Snek (Snake) game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. The goal is to grow it as long as possible without bumping into the side walls, bumping into itself or another player, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.
